# Overview

This repository contains the final lab of the Software Design and Analysis course I took at Polytechnique Montr√©al. In this lab, I have applied my UML and C++ knowledge that I gained through the coursework, thus the name of the repo.

This lab was completed in collaboration with [Mo-LK](https://github.com/Mo-LK).
